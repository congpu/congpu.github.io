                     <b>Purpose:</b> Week of Welcome (WOW) is part of the First Year Experience at Marshall University. WOW
                     serves as more than a class or program; it is an experience that is essential to the success of
                     first-year students at Marshall. It is a collaborative, introductory effort to welcome, educate
                     and socialize freshmen to the Marshall University campus, academic expectations, personnel,
                     resources and traditions during the first few weeks of the fall semester.
